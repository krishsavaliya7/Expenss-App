# 📊 Core Features

## 1️⃣ Smart Group Expense Management

Users can create groups, add members, and track shared expenses easily.

Features include:

* add expenses
* split bills among members
* track balances within groups
* view group expense history

---

## 2️⃣ Greedy Debt Minimization Algorithm

SplitSmart reduces unnecessary transactions using a **Greedy algorithm**.

Example:

Before optimization:

User A → User B ₹200
User B → User C ₹150
User C → User A ₹300

After optimization:

User C → User B ₹50
User C → User A ₹150

This significantly reduces the number of settlements required.

---

## 3️⃣ UPI-Style Payment Simulation

SplitSmart simulates a **real-time UPI payment experience** without using external payment gateways.

Users can:

* select **Pay via UPI**
* confirm simulated payment
* instantly settle debts

This allows realistic FinTech demonstrations during hackathons without requiring real banking APIs.

---

## 4️⃣ Cash Settlement with Receiver Approval

For users who prefer offline transactions:

1. Debtor selects **Settle by Cash**
2. Receiver receives settlement request
3. Receiver approves the transaction
4. Ledger is updated automatically

This supports real-world scenarios where not everyone uses digital payments.

---

## 5️⃣ Immutable Ledger System

All settlements are recorded in a **tamper-proof ledger**.

Each transaction contains:

* transaction ID
* sender
* receiver
* amount
* timestamp
* previous hash
* current hash

Hash calculation:

SHA256(
transaction_id +
from_user +
to_user +
amount +
timestamp +
previous_hash
)

This creates a **chain of transactions similar to blockchain systems**, ensuring data integrity.

---

## 6️⃣ Ledger Verification

The platform verifies the integrity of transaction records by checking the hash chain.

If any transaction is modified, the ledger becomes invalid.

This ensures **secure financial record keeping**.

---

## 7️⃣ Notification System

Users receive notifications for:

* new expenses
* settlement requests
* payment confirmations
* ledger updates

This improves user awareness and collaboration in groups.
